          <h1>What is Net Neutrality?</h1>
          <h3>Updated May 14, 2019 | Katelyn Mirabelli</h3>  
          <p><img src="https://cdn.glitch.com/538f2f6b-ca9a-4068-9950-9f1ae488e2b5%2FDay_of_Action_to_Save_Net_Neutrality_01.jpg?1557864316725" alt="Stuck in the Slow Lane" width="600px"></p> 
          <p>The term Net Neutrality was coined in 2002 by Columbia law professor, Tim Wu. "Network neutrality is the idea that internet service providers (ISPs), including cable companies like Time Warner and wireless providers like Sprint, should treat all internet traffic equally. It says your ISP shouldn’t be allowed to block or degrade access to certain websites or services, nor should it be allowed to set aside a 'fast lane' that allows content favored by the ISP to load more quickly than the rest" (Lee, 2015). According to the website Battle for the Net, “Net neutrality is the basic principle that protects our free speech on the Internet….and prevents Internet Service Providers...from slowing down and blocking websites, or charging apps and sites extra fees to reach an audience (which they then pass along to consumers).”</p> 
          <p>Advocates believe that net neutrality lowers barriers to entry online and makes it easier for entrepreneurs and new businesses to complete as equally as possible with larger, more established companies.</p>
          <p>However, critics argue that  regulations actually reduces investment in internet infrastructure and limits Internet Service providers flexibility in their business models to innovate.</p>
          <p>Net neutrality is an important topic that has been in the news with some frequency for the past several years due to a resurgence in debate from both sides of the argument. Congress, the Federal Communications Commission(FCC), and the courts have all debated whether and how to protect network neutrality.</p> 
          <p>The goal of this website is to break down the recent news, historical timeline, identify central players and movements, and link to further resources for site visitors to get involved and take a stand.  This site is specifically geared toward information professionals, but is accessible for all.</p> 
          <p>Given the current political climate, it is difficult to tell what will happen next when each issue becomes a bargaining chip for power. It is important that the public remain apprised and that consumers are protected against an Internet that could further contribute to a socioeconomic digital divide.</p>

            <h1>What’s Happening Now? Progress of the HR-1644 Bill</h1>
            <h3>Updated May 14, 2019 | Maddy Newquist </h3>
            <p>On April 9, 2019, the United States House of Representatives voted in favor of net neutrality by passing the HR-1644, in a 232-190 vote. It currently sits with the Senate after its first reading, awaiting the next vote.</p>
             
            <p><img src="https://cdn.glitch.com/538f2f6b-ca9a-4068-9950-9f1ae488e2b5%2FHR-1644%20progress%20bar.png?1556998835622" alt="HR-1644 in Congress progress bar" width="500px"></p> 
    
            <p>What exactly is HR-1644? HR-1644, titled the “Save the Internet Act of 2019,” would restore the net neutrality protections that keep cable and Internet service providers from changing their tiers of service without regard to the needs of the customers who use them.</p>
           
            <p>Without net neutrality, these companies would have the ability to provide a slower internet for customers who were paying for a lower priced package or for those using different data plans from other companies; could censor content at will; and could impose fees for a variety of arbitrary reasons.</p>
            
            <p>HR-1644 is a short, three-page bill—and we’ve posted it below. The brevity of the bill itself shows how simple the concept of net neutrality is to defend—and thereby protect.</p>

            <p>The Save the Internet Act of 2019 would ensure that the 2015 Open Internet Order cannot again be repealed as easily as it was by the FCC in 2017. This would keep unelected bureaucrats from being able to change laws without the lawmakers’ or their constituents’ input.</p>

            <p>And lawmakers aren’t divided by party on this issue! As proven by the April 9th vote in the House, this issue crosses party lines and there are lawmakers who are willing to stand behind it. A poll released during the controversial FCC rollback in 2017 showed that 83% of Americans wanted to keep net neutrality intact, and now many politicians are willing to listen and stand up for Americans’ right to equal internet access.</p>

            <h1>Key Players</h1>
            <h3>Updated May 14, 2019 | Katelyn Mirabelli</h3>
            <p><img src="https://cdn.glitch.com/538f2f6b-ca9a-4068-9950-9f1ae488e2b5%2Fgiphy.gif?1557862114452" alt="Death of the Internet" width= "300"><img></p>
            <p>Net Neutrality is a complex topic with many groups and different perspectives on the matter. Below is a list of key stakeholders and main arguments for/against Net Neutrality:</p>
            <br/><br/>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Internet Service Providers</strong></li> 
              <li>An Internet service provider (ISP) is an organization that provides services for accessing, using, or participating in the Internet. Internet service providers may be organized in various forms, such as commercial, community-owned, non-profit, or otherwise privately owned (Internet, 2018). Comcast, is currently the United States’ largest internet provider. AT&T, Verizon, and Spectrum are also large providers in the United States (Internet, 2018).</li>   

              <li><strong>Federal Communications Commission (FCC)</strong></li> 
              <li>Back in 2017, Federal Communications Commission Chair Ajit Pai said that, “the agency's net-neutrality rules are discouraging investment, leaving consumers with fewer, and less robust, choices for internet service, and potentially widening the digital divide” (Finley, 2017).</li> 

              <li>Pai, a Republican, was appointed as head of the FCC by President Trump. He pushed the agency to repeal the regulatory oversight for Internet service providers that Democrats approved in 2015 under Obama due to objections from the broadband industry (Puzzanghera, 2017).</li>  

              <li><strong>Federal Trade Commission (FTC)</strong></li> 
              <li>The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) will take over policing ISPs on issues like Net Neutrality since the FCC has eased their regulations. While the FCC traditionally focused on regulating the telecom industry, the FTC has authority over consumer protection in all industries and is suited to receive complaints <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/faq/consumer-protection/submit-consumer-complaint-ftc">here</a> (Cooper, 2018).</li>  


              <li><strong>Tech Companies</strong></li>  
              <li>Explore our <a href="https://net-neutrality-project.glitch.me/#eight">Day of Action</a> page to see which tech companies are fighting in favor of Net Neutrality</li>

              <li><strong>Internet Users</strong></li> 
              <li>The average person may not consider the effect that Net Neutrality has on daily life; however, it’s important to bring awareness to issue. Without regulation, it could be more expensive and difficult to access your preferred information sources or for smaller businesses and solo practitioners to scale up without incurring large fees.</li>

            <h1>Why This Matters for Information Professionals</h1>
            <h3>Updated May 14, 2019 | Maddy Newquist </h3>
          <p><img src="https://cdn.glitch.com/538f2f6b-ca9a-4068-9950-9f1ae488e2b5%2FDon't%20Tread%20on%20Me.png?1557870531410" alt="Don't Tread on Me" width="600"></p>
          <p>Net neutrality is often positioned, rightly and understandably, as being an issue that affects everyone at an individual and personal level. But this also means that it is more difficult to unpack what the potential tamping down of net neutrality would mean for the professions that act as mediators and ethical protectors of information and information accessibility.</p>

          <p>Information professionals inherently inhabit non-neutral roles in society—and society is increasingly asking them to not be neutral. Toronto’s Board of Trade wants the Toronto Public Library and its librarians to be the keepers and custodians of the city’s public data; their argument is that librarians hold citizens’ data privacy and safety (in all forms) as a main tenet of their profession. User-experience designers too are facing ethical questions as the last couple years have brought what feels like near-constant theft and dispersal of personal information on national and international scales from trusted social websites and technological platforms. </p>

          <p>Net neutrality is thus an issue that information professionals must pay special attention to. Already, official organizations are taking a stance: In June of 2018, the International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions (IFLA) released a toolkit on net neutrality for libraries and librarian associations. Both the Society of American Archivists and the American Library Association have official stances, with statements on each of their websites that come down firmly in favor of net neutrality and which detail out how each organization will follow through on its advocacy. Libraries provide internet access to communities and users who may not already have reliable access, as well as valuable resources to research institutions, and a rollback of net neutrality could severely limit the ability to access library content and basic functions.</p>

          <p>And while libraries may be the most community-facing institutions of the information field, UX design would also suffer mightily under a lack of net neutrality. Designers have issued calls for support from others in the field, citing threats to UX such as:</p>
            <ul> 
              <li>Throwing money at a design flaw rather than attempting to solve the problem from an ethical and social design perspective.</li>
              <li>When companies are not required to think it terms of user-friendliness, all UX designers’ livelihoods are at stake.</li>
              <li>Internet service providers throttling internet speeds can keep users and customers from reaching smaller UX sites, while promoting others with more capital to spend.</li>
            </ul>
